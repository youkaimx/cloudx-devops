# README 

This is to satisfy https://catalog.workshops.aws/general-immersionday/en-US/basic-modules/50-rds/rds

For convenience, it also includes the code for the EC2 Lab mentioned.   
Please take a look at the  comments in the `secrets.tf`  file, as there some difference between that is asked in the LAB and what is really needed for the webpage to work.

File `secrets.auto.tfvars` should not be included but for convienience is included since it does not contain sensitive data
